# Sampling Long-Term Groundwater Monitoring Networks Using Spatially Balanced Designs with Proportional Inclusion Probabilities

#### Spatially balanced sampling is a popular probability sampling method in environmental monitoring surveys that ensures even spatial coverage over the area of interest. The inclusion probabilities of potential sampling locations in the sampling design can be proportional to auxiliary information, providing control over the sample selection. This simulation study evaluates an approach for using the estimates of spatiotemporal statistical models as auxiliary information to tune sample inclusion probabilities. In the proposed approach, the sample inclusion probabilities are proportional to predicted distances between spatial features of interest, such as boundaries or hotspots of the population, and the sampling locations. The approach allows for using the information from each campaign to adjust the sampling design for the next in long-term monitoring projects, thus tracking changes in the spatial and temporal distribution of the environmental variables of interest. This study evaluates the proportional inclusion probability design on synthetic groundwater quality monitoring data that consist of concentration measurements of a hypothetical solute. Monitoring wells predicted to be closer to or within the boundary of the solute plume were more likely to be selected for sampling. The proposed sampling design was compared to simple random sampling (SRS) without replacement and equal probability spatially balanced sampling (SBS). Evaluation was based on the errors of statistical models from the three designs. The results highlight the benefits of SBS compared to SRS, while the proportional probability designs resulted in more accurate concentration estimates within the plume. Overall, the advantages of the proposed design are dependent on monitoring objectives and the statistical model being applied to the monitoring data.

## Data Sets

The "Data" folder contains data sets for 3 hypothetical solute plumes in groundwater. The data were generated by [McLean et al. (2019)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2018.10.231) using MODFLOW and MT3D. They are referred to as simple, mid and complex plumes due to their spatial complexity.
